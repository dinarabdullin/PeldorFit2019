PeldorFit2019
=========
A program PeldorFit is developed for analysis of orientation-selective Pulsed ELectron-electron Double Resonance (PELDOR or DEER) data.


***

PeldorFit2019 is the third version of the program PeldorFit. The changes made to the second version are:

1) The program is extended to three-spin systems.

2) The structure of the configuration file is reconsidered to make it more general.

3) New Python scripts for visualization of the PeldorFit results are provided.

***

Further description of the program can be found in the manual and in the paper (see below).

General Information
=========
The source code of the program is written in C++.
